## 👩‍🔬 About Me

I am a **pharmacist and M.Sc. graduate**, currently pursuing my **Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute of Science** (Laufman Lab).  
My research investigates how **enteroviruses**—such as *Coxsackievirus B3*—interact with host cellular machineries,  
with a focus on the **Cytosolic Iron–Sulfur Assembly (CIA) complex** and **nuclear transport systems**.

I’m passionate about unraveling the molecular logic of host–virus interactions and turning complex datasets into clear biological insights.
